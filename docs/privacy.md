# Privacy policy design

## Main promise

FreeAI Open does not see your conversations.

Your prompts, AI responses, uploaded documents, and chat history stay on your device by default.

## What never leaves the browser by default

- prompts
- model responses
- documents
- extracted document text
- conversation history
- locally stored conversations
- local files
- private notes
- API keys

## What may be sent

Only redacted technical telemetry:

- error codes
- selected model ID
- backend
- performance mode
- task category
- app version
- approximate browser/OS family
- device tier
- performance metrics

## User controls

Users should be able to:

- disable telemetry;
- view the last data sent;
- export debug logs;
- erase local logs;
- erase local conversations;
- erase model cache;
- export/import local conversations;
- enable encrypted Drive sync later.

## Local conversations

Conversation persistence is local-only. Stored conversations may contain user prompts and assistant responses, so they must not be sent to telemetry, diagnostic reports, Supabase, Google Drive, or any server endpoint by default.

The conversation store uses IndexedDB when available and an in-memory fallback when IndexedDB is unavailable. The fallback is temporary and disappears when the page session ends.
