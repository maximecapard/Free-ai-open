# Privacy policy design

## Main promise

FreeAI Open does not see your conversations.

Your prompts, AI responses, uploaded documents, and chat history stay on your device by default.

## What never leaves the browser by default

- prompts
- model responses
- documents
- extracted document text
- conversation history
- locally stored conversations
- local files
- private notes
- API keys

## What may be sent

Only redacted technical telemetry:

- error codes
- selected model ID
- backend
- performance mode
- task category
- app version
- approximate browser/OS family
- device tier
- performance metrics

## User controls

Users should be able to:

- disable telemetry;
- view the last data sent;
- export debug logs;
- erase local logs;
- erase local conversations;
- erase model cache;
- export/import local conversations;
- enable encrypted Drive sync later.

Implemented today: erase local conversations (delete from the `/chat` history sidebar), and erase/view/export local logs and the diagnostic report (`/debug`). A telemetry on/off toggle, erasing the model cache, export/import of local conversations, and encrypted Drive sync are not implemented yet — see [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).

## Local conversations

Conversation persistence is local-only. Stored conversations may contain user prompts and assistant responses, so they must not be sent to telemetry, diagnostic reports, Supabase, Google Drive, or any server endpoint by default.

The conversation store uses IndexedDB when available and an in-memory fallback when IndexedDB is unavailable. The fallback is temporary and disappears when the page session ends.

Sprint 5.1 adds unit coverage for the IndexedDB store, no-IndexedDB memory fallback, active conversation ID pointer, local-log rejection of conversation content fields, diagnostic-report exclusion of conversation-shaped input, and absence of `fetch`/`sendBeacon` paths in the conversation store.
